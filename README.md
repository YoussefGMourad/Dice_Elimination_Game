# 🎲 Dice Elimination Game  

A fun and interactive **Python dice game** where the goal is to remove all numbers from **1 to 12** using dice rolls.  
This game was inspired by my earlier **"Roll the Dice" project**, which only simulated rolling two dice. I expanded that idea into a full elimination game with rules and strategy.

## 🔹 Features  
- Roll two dice each turn.  
- Remove numbers based on:  
  - The **sum of the dice** (die1 + die2).  
  - Or **both dice results together** (die1 and die2).  
- Tracks remaining numbers dynamically.  
- Ends when you clear all numbers or have no valid moves.  

---

## 🛠️ How to Play  
1. Run the script in your Python environment.  
2. Decide whether to roll the dice (`y`) or quit (`n`).  
3. Choose from the available valid moves.  
4. Continue until:  
   - You remove all numbers (🎉 Win), or  
   - No valid moves remain (❌ Game Over).

## 🌱 Future Work  
- **Refactor for Better Structure**: Organize the game logic into functions and classes.  
- **Add a GUI**: Create an interactive interface using `tkinter` or `PyQt`.  
- **Enhance Gameplay**: multiplayer mode.

## 📌 Requirements  
- Python 3.x
